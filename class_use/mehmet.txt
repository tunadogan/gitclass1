I turn off the light of my room in the rains
and a sincere prayer
for lightning to strike
It's like a branch falls on every note of mine
raw raw fills me up
in each of my lines
my inkwell is full of tears with ink
I'm writing with my tears
your shadow reflected on the wall from lightning
my wall is always white
like you
like your memory
maybe not you
but like my dream...

I rejoice in every single drop
I'm drawing you in the dark
looking at your shadow
living with your dream
I'm breathing with the rain
my frozen heart
my eyes are moist
and your shadow
